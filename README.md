## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dominik, I am 25 years old from eastern germany.
I am currently working as a professional software developer in the point of sale area.

My main focus is the backend development but i also enjoy building innovative UIs and love the integration of APIs.

In my free time I work on my own little projects, but I also love to hike and play ice hockey.
